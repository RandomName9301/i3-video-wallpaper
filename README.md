## Optional Dependencies
- ffmpeg (to generate thumbnail)
- feh (to set wallpaper)

## Usage
```bash
./setup.sh [OPTIONS] [VIDEO,BLUR_GEOMETRY,TIME_STAMP]
```
- VIDEO: Path to video.
- BLUR_GEOMETRY: Value which is passed to `convert -blur [value]`. (Default: `16x16`)
- TIME_STAMP: The time to generate the thumbnail. (Default: `00:00:01`) 

## Examples
Always play `video.mp4` for **all** monitors.
```bash
./setup.sh -a video.mp4
```

Always play `video.mp4`, generate a thumbnail and set the **blurred** thumbnail as wallpaper for all monitors.
```bash
./setup.sh -anwb video.mp4
```

Always play `video.mp4` for **Monitor 1** and `video2.mp4` for **Monitor 2 and beyond**, set `BLUR_GEOMETRY` to `32x32` for the blurred thumbnail of `video2.mp4`, generate thumbnails and set the blurred thumbnails as wallpaper for the monitors.
```bash
./setup.sh -anwb video.mp4 video2.mp4,32x32
```
## Options
```
  -a: Always run video wallpaper.
  -n: Generate a thumbnail by using ffmpeg. It may be useful if you use the built-in system tray of Polybar. (This can fix the background of system tray)
  -w: Set the generated thumbnail as wallpaper by using feh. It may be useful if you use the built-in system tray of Polybar. (This can fix the background of system tray)
  -b: Blur the thumbnail. It may be useful if your compositor does not blur the background of the built-in system tray of Polybar.
  -f: Value which is passed to "feh --bg-[value]". Available options: center|fill|max|scale|tile (Default: fill)
